## 💡 Features

- Add new banks with net transaction amounts
- Display all banks (in sorted order using AVL Tree)
- Track and compare net transaction amounts
- Balance factor calculation and tree rotation
- Console-based menu-driven interface

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- AVL Tree (Self-balancing Binary Search Tree)
- File Handling
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## 📂 File Structure

- `main.cpp`: Main program file (logic and UI)
- `README.md`: Project overview
